# School Girl

mummy scrapes her

ponytail

back so tightly you

can see her vein

pulse

      pulse

            pulse

purple

in her forehead.

In class they

stand in a circle

her nails are cut

so short

that when she holds

her classmates’

chubby hands

she passes along her

own heartbeat,

It throbs

      through

          them and

back to her.

then the lunch bell rings and

she throws out her food

not knowing how

to eat

without her

nosepinchedclosed

of all the playground games

she is the best at *Tag*

*take my hand,*

*ill teach you how to run*

It is the only thing

she has ever

done.
