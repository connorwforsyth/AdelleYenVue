# Ferdydurke

*Found poem written using posters on the walls of Ferdydurke bar, Melbourne* 

Every Wednesday night in dada’s house,

management reserves the right to refuse exit

no dickheads

the politically challenged must have proof of empathy

like men who think of the turtles

over idiots who can’t visualise horses

galloping on tomatoes

Comrades!

beware of troublemakers

some might be in the crowd with you

being interested

beats being right

cavity search may apply

friends only

mystery is a thing with paradoxes

lies make baby Jesus cry
