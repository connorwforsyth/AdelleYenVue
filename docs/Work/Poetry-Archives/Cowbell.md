*sweetheart, I know,*

*I know-*

*this is*

*your first time*

*I remember how*

*tough it was*

*and I know you want to see him-*

*your- your little one.*

*just try not to think too hard.*

*trust me-*

*I’ve done this* 

*thrice before.*

*the water before- it* 

*cleans us-*

*so when you feel the spray*

*close your eyes. expectation*

*lessens the* 

*pain.*

*the biggest lesson I’ve learned:*

*the only thing that*

*breeds trauma*

*is fear*
