To her son,

For the first time, I find myself wishing my mind was playing tricks on me…for the first time, it is not. For as long as I have lived, I would have never thot- out of anybody who could have possibly hurt me- that it would end up being my own son…if you were I thot you to be, you would overcome these beastly urges, this corrosion of manhood. every time you hurt yourself you hurt me too- you do, my skin, my heart, my womb where you lay- is that what you want? To punish me? I have devoted my life to you, Percy… never wronged you...if only you would do the same for me.
