                                                       *object category: bodices**[[1]](the%20lost%20lady%20found,%201904%20a0f5aaa486d3407b9558cbb1cdaab85f.md)***

in the pink light of dusk their

hands are clasped together in

dance:

her son, his sweetheart and

she.

the summer night breathes

out a feverish

heat that melts their faces

into something resembling

strawberry jam.

she pulls him aside. through

her teeth:

*you love me, don’t*

*you? more than you love,*

to the right, his sweetheart

is dancing alone.

*her?*

when percy smiles she 

sees herself in his 

eyes. when he

twirls her round and round and

round and round it is a

flurry of perfect white

limbs-

and it is this: the evening and the

music, both full of promises

they can’t keep.
