she lives in fear that one day she

will sing him a

lullaby and never hear

it back {a  strike to the legs}

she often-

dreams in a language

that is only spoken through

scores. at

three-o-clock on   the   dot, she feels

the ebb and          flow of words,

he plays grief in

buttery blue-eyed prose

his heartbeat {one,  two,   three}

humming        in her chest, and in

his fingers,       *hers*

{four   strikes across

his bottom}

the hold of a mother,

the hold of a    mother.
