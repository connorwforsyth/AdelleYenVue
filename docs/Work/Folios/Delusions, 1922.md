sometimes at sundown, in the dusty room where the grand piano lies, she sinks to the ground. soft head cradled by the floorboards, wood laving her body. the little boy at the piano with his cotton wool fingers. a clew of leeches drink from her her hands, her lips, her eyes. hours- then the boy evaporates- and on her face traces of a smile. still drinking. music playing, when it’s not. her limbs liquify to the waxing and waning of the moon.
