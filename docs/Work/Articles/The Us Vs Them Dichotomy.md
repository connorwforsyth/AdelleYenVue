# The Us vs Them Dichotomy in Identity Politics

-- My assignment submission for my PEN Melbourne class: surrounding and defending freedom of speech--

***I. Who am I? My Cultural Identity in Context.***

Until three years ago, I had never really thought deeply about how I identified myself in a cultural setting. As a person of Chinese ethnicity from both Singapore and Malaysia, my parents’ choice to enrol us in an international school since the age of five-years-old was one that was deliberately considered. They wanted us to speak perfect English, *maybe even in a British accent,* my mum always hoped. In school, we celebrated everything from Christmas to Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Deepavali and Thai Pusam. My sister and I were both surrounded by diversity but were taught through a Westernised lens. We left high-school being coined as, much to my extended family’s disappointment, ‘bananas’.

banana person (yellow outside, white inside)

***Banana*** is a pejorative term for ethnic East Asian or Southeast Asian people who are considered to have abandoned their Asian cultural identity or lost touch with it in order to adopt a western cultural identity.

(Penaksovic, 1992)

So I grew up confused about where I actually stood. I related to Westernized media, language, and speech, but also traditional Chinese mindsets surrounding school, family, and tradition. So was I a ‘Banana’? Or was I a ‘Chink’?

Beginning to study creative writing and Media- essentially, Arts- at a university that predominantly supported left-wing ideologies, I quickly noticed how often cultural identity was discussed. Suddenly, concepts within identity politics like cultural appropriation, ‘Othered’ communities, and P.O.C (Person of Colour) were brought to my attention more than ever before. While I had received the occasional ignorant racial remark, I had never particularly felt marginalised for it at school. Yet at university, I was evidently thrown into this collective Other, and there was a pressure that I should have felt as such. I started speaking about my ‘culture’ through a minority lens- in ways that weren’t completely authentic.

Fundamentally, I also realised that because I was Othered, anything I had to say or write about other minority groups was usually considered in the blink of an eye.

***II. Writing in the age of identity politics- my experience.***

Does someone from a ‘minority’ background have more authority to speak to a ‘wider minority’? And who gets to determine that?

I found myself thinking about identity politics with regards to minorities and wider minorities whilst working on a multilingual poem in class. After failing to write a poem in Chinese and English, I had asked my Sino-Mauritian partner to help me translate a few phrases into Mauritian-Creole.

The poem was inspired by Sega*, and was inspired by the song Freedom Fry (*I feel the light running through my veins*).  Sega was born from the music of African slaves, and was a musical form that expressed suffering, but later on, freedom. I had questioned submitting it, wondering if I was appropriating Mauritian culture. 

**Sega: Traditional Mauritian Music*

I then asked my class whether my poem seemed insensitive. Receiving nothing but good feedback and reassurance that I shouldn't censor my writing, I was surprised by how well regarded it was. In my other writing classes, I had seen White person after White person being slandered for writing about cultures that weren’t theirs.

I was relieved. Maybe I had done something right- maybe I had succeeded in writing about someone else’s culture in a respectful way.

*Sorry, Anna. We don’t need another White girl telling us about South-Asian Culture.* 

Yet I couldn’t help but question the difference between Anna and me. She had written about the beautiful hustle and bustle in India. On a level of appreciation for the cultures we were writing about, we levelled out; I simply couldn’t comprehend why our feedback was so starkly different.

In *The Benefits of Being Ethnic*, Benjamin Law (2010), Asian-Australian, writes humorously about South/South-East Asian ethnicity. *If you’re ethnic, everyone wants a piece of you. You’re as collectable as a pokemon*. The article ends with: *If a white person wrote this, it would probably be howled down in a raging pit of fury or published in Quadrant.*

***III. “But hey, I can get away with it. I’m Asian, remember?”-  Speaking as a ‘cultural Other’***

It was brought to my attention by my friends- those who considered the situation with no prior knowledge bias- that there was one difference between Anna and I: In the Western eye, I am an ‘Other’, and she is not. Therefore, I have an unfair 'cultural advantage' to write about other minorities, like I did Afro-Mauritians.

*The ‘Other’*

Member of a dominated out-group, whose identity is considered lacking and who may be subject to discrimination by the in-group.

*Also: Othering:* transforming a difference into otherness so as to create an in-group and an out-group

*Also: Otherness*: characteristic of the Other

(Staszak, 2008)

This philosophy was introduced by German philosopher, Edmund Husserl, but took the geographical world by storm in the 1980s (Staszak, 2008). At the time, geographers were interested in the way minority groups in the 1960s distinguished themselves from dominant (white, male) cultures. For instance, The Combahee River Collective in 1997, was a black feminist organisation declared an ‘other’ identity to become visible and gain in attention in women’s liberation struggles (Fowlkes, 1997). Issues around ‘otherness’ still remain today, albeit in somewhat altered form.

As time progressed, I noticed similar patterns continually arising in the university context. Students like myself who were considered cultural others- Singaporean students, Japanese students and students ‘alike’- were praised for writing not only about their own ethnicities, cultures, and backgrounds, but also for writing about other cultural minorities.

 Just last week, my White-Australian friend expressed her upset to me; a biography she wrote about an Indigenous woman was shut down by her White- Australian tutor, despite her subject thanking her for putting her story into such beautiful words. Both her and Anna were judged by their cultural insensitivity; being individuals with white privilege, they should not be writing about cultural minorities. It was not their story to tell, they were told. Yet, on the same day, the same tutor praised a girl of Indian ethnicity for telling the story of a woman of African ethnicity.

***IV. My problem with othering***

Edward Said (1978, p.18) Says:

*“To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is epistemological and natural- our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.”*

The experiences recounted above paint a very small-scale, yet scarily accurate picture of the way many individuals think about identity in a cultural sense. Within the realm of identity politics, specifically contemporary usage of terms like *P.O.C* or ‘Othering’, a discourse is created of conflicting- and at times even hypocritical- statements.

To contextualise this, I will use Western universities as an example. Anna (as aforementioned) when writing about her trip to India, wrote about how beautiful and vibrant Indian streets looked compared to Australia’s. Her attempt at being culturally respectful was unsuccessful, and she was immediately labelled as a failure. Nobody in the class directed Anna to educational resources that may have explained why. 

It seemed that many of my White university tutors believed that the best way to educate White students was to tell them to stop asking questions or writing about ‘Othered’ communities. I thought: Does this ‘simple solution’ perpetuate White Guilt and encourage exoneration and inaction instead of accountability and understanding?

There have been a number of racial movements that have succeeded in exceeding radical white women’s movements such as The Combahee River Movement (Fowlkes 1997) and the reclamation of Orientalism,(Said, 1978). Organisations like PEN international aim to provide education surrounding racial injustices and empower the voices of writers who are killed, tormented and imprisoned because of their lack of freedom of expression. I can’t help but wonder if the emancipatory prospects of these organisations are weakened by elites who throw around contemporary identity terms that actually promote White Silence. 

I have further noticed tokenistic practices that show a clear divide and advantage towards an individual who is associated with a part of a minority group. When I first started university, I was fed inadvertently by my tutors, all of whom are White and colonial, that we all exist in an oppressive society. The little Year Eleven knowledge of history I had didn’t give me much of a sense of historical comparison to make, so I believed the things I was told: that to achieve in life, we needed to defeat this unjust system. 

Yet I am ashamed to admit that I was falling deeper into the trap of using my identity group, my ethnicity- one that I didn’t even fully identify with- to gain the approval of my peers, essentially, for my own gain.  In my creative writing class, I was praised for referring to my Chinese family members with Chinese characters. People told me it was ‘beautiful’. The same people put down others for not being as alert to injustice as they were.

I do not blame those who choose to identify with Otherness. Historical evidence demonstrates that minority groups are marginalised on account of skin colour, race, or assumed character traits (Fowlkes, 1997)  It is then natural to normalise these classifications as part of us as individuals in a proud repossession of said offensive term.  However, there is a danger of perceiving cultural minorities and cultural non-minorities as a dichotomy; the idea of having a First vs the Other- an In-group vs an Out-group, an Us vs Them- only perpetuates the cultural binary, instead of transcending it.

The fact is, less-than-ideal cultural representations in regard to socio-political power and hierarchies of dominance undoubtedly exist. But I argue that contemporary Othering has become superficial, and lessens complex, individual issues down to simply a competition on who is more ‘culturally aware’. University, the perfect space to explore said complexities, is then reduced to an environment where individuals are self-censored and scared to understand or be curious about another’s culture.

I have been told repeatedly to oppose the dominant discourse- one run by privileged men, by the superior race, by white colonials. But what if the dominant discourse fed to us in university now insinuates giving free passes to every cultural other and reprimanding every privileged individual- based on the sole fact that they are privileged?

***V. An inconclusive conclusion***

Until three years ago, I had never really thought deeply about how I identified myself in a cultural setting. After trying to fit myself into a mould that was pushed on me in university, my self-identification still remains unsound. 

This piece simply reflects on my racial identity in context of the *Us Vs Them* dichotomy that is unintentionally reflected in university tutors’ practices. Studying writing in university, I found that my racial identity was often carelessly grouped with one of an alternative ‘Other’, and I was given the unfair privilege to speak on behalf of a culture that wasn’t mine. The same dichotomy reprimanded White students from doing the same. 

In an attempt to educate, I argue that the *Us Vs Them* dichotomy presents situations as being necessarily adversarial when it could be educational and cooperative. 

I strongly believe that we should not demonise writing about others’ cultures when the person is coming from an authentic place seeking to understand. Instead, we should promote education surrounding issues that may arise. I also believe that each situation is extremely complex, and has interwoven threads that all need to be considered before judgment can occur. 

Finally, I believe that if we as a society can build new experiences, responsibilities and methods of relating to each other, we can hopefully begin to be content with our ever-changing identities, the ones that no sense of self can revise.
