**Disclaimer:** Throughout the article, I refer to 'dissociation' and habits of dissociating. This is in reference to group dissociation habits, as defined in the article. It is NOT referring to dissociation as "a psychological experience in which people feel disconnected from their sensory experience, sense of self, or personal history" , which is a very common definition associated with symptoms of certain mental illnesses".

### The Classroom Divide

Choosing where to sit in a university tutorial is an awkward process every student had to go through even before COVID-19.

What’s difficult to ignore is how we’re divided in class: domestic students, Chinese (People’s Republic of China, aka PRC)  students, and all other international students.

You then have to make the decision whether to sit on the table that you feel is the most “representative” of you, or choose to go against the grain and sit on one that isn’t. Either way, this situation has made a lot of students, myself included, very uncomfortable.

This classroom dynamic has been acceptable for a long time; my parents, who are Malaysian-Chinese and Singaporean-Chinese, shared similar experiences at the University of Western Australia 35 years ago.

They told me that they had never questioned it, understanding that “of course locals want to sit with other locals”. After all, they themselves had felt more comfortable when they grouped up with like students, those that shared similar methods of communication, backgrounds, cultures.

Fast forward to COVID-19 with classes transitioned online - not much had changed. A few weeks ago my class was told to privately reach out to individuals we wanted to work with for a group assignment, and the three categories revealed themselves once again:

1. Domestic students
2. Chinese (PRC) students
3. All other international students

When I started to reflect more on this weird and unquestionable student divide, I realised that many of my experiences in the past had led me to the point of accepting it - *and I wasn’t okay with that.*

### Casual Racism to Not-so Casual Racism

When I was six years old, my parents enrolled me in a British international school in Malaysia. Here, we were predominantly taught, both academically and socially, to admire and adhere to Western norms and ways of life. Here I was made familiar with casual racism.

People joked that I “camouflaged” into yellow walls, and made cracks about “how I could see through my small eyes”, how I did my friends’ homework because I was Asian and “logically” smart by default.

I had heard all the racial stereotypes in the book by the time I left school, but I laughed them off and wasn’t personally affected by them.

Anyway, people told me they shouldn’t matter to me because “I was basically White”.

—

When I started university in Melbourne, I encountered casual racial stereotyping again- but now on a larger scale. I noticed a different, more specific set of stereotypes surrounding Chinese (PRC) students than those I had experienced in high school:

1. **Grandiosity:** paying their way through uni, flashy, designer clothes, expensive city lifestyles, expensive cars
2. **Antisocial behaviour:** non-English speaking, cliquey, only hang out with each other, lack of initiative, awkward, shy

At my residential college, both local and non-PRC international students often complained about being sat next to ‘all the rich, spoiled Chinese students’ who ‘didn't contribute’, and who were ‘rude’ because they seldom spoke English.

Even my Chinese-Malaysian friend had advised me not to go to *UNSW* (The University of New South Wales) **because it ‘felt like Chinatown’.

My previous experiences in school made it especially hard not to notice that ‘Westernised’ international students were almost always more respected by others than ‘non-Westernised’ students.

### The tendency to dissociate from stereotypes

It became clearer that although these stereotypes didn’t ‘matter’ to me, I saw firsthand how much they isolated Chinese (PRC) students. Up until uni, I had rejected racial stereotypes that were aimed at me instead of acknowledging them - and I wasn’t alone in doing this.

There is a distinct [intragroup fragmentation](https://connect.springerpub.com/content/book/978-0-8261-9926-3/part/part01/chapter/ch01) between ‘members’ of a marginalised group that often occurs when members discriminate amongst one another; the division of those who subconsciously reject stereotypes, and those who don’t.

By rejecting stereotypes in the past, I experienced *[group dissociation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324796012_Age-Stereotype_Internalization_and_Dissociation_Contradictory_Processes_or_Two_Sides_of_the_Same_Coin)*, the ‘tendency to put a psychological distance between oneself’ and the group we are stereotyped into.

For me, this was distancing myself from Chinese (PRC) students, those who shared my ethnicity, by blatantly trying to contradict these stereotypes; I would complain about being in all-chinese uni groups because I feared that I would be “stuck doing all the work” and constantly socialising to make sure that I didn’t seem “anti-social”.

> This common trope that kept coming up summed it all; the “We’re Not All Like That”  … often [manifesting] into the view that Chinese (PRC) students are born with a ‘silver spoon in their mouths’ who neither appreciate their advantage, nor have they worked for their achievements; in effect, they do not deserve respect.

I was curious to see if there were others who also recognised the prevalence of group dissociation within international students. However, I found that rather than being conscious of dissociation, many online articles actually perpetuated dissociation habits.

This common trope that kept coming up summed it all; the “We’re Not All Like That” mentality often used by ethnically-Chinese (but non-PRC) international university students like me to dissociate with students from China.

This trope often manifests into the view that Chinese (PRC) students are born with a ‘silver spoon in their mouths’ who neither appreciate their advantage, nor have they worked for their achievements; in effect, they do not deserve respect.

Both intragroup fragmentation and group dissociation habits are not surprising within the context of Australian universities, as [dissociation is more likely when the stereotypes are obvious and blatant, and within strongly stereotyped domains](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/324796012_Age-Stereotype_Internalization_and_Dissociation_Contradictory_Processes_or_Two_Sides_of_the_Same_Coin/link/5bcd7f7992851cae21b8d7c7/download). As international students often perceive that they are valued less than domestic students, it makes sense that they might actively dissociate to defend themselves from anticipated racism.

### Dissociation only intensifies stereotypes

Dissociating from Chinese (PRC) students only intensifies stereotypes directed towards them: laziness, unsociability, and undeserved privilege.

When students stereotype Chinese (PRC) students and other international students dissociate from them, this means that they are often excluded by both domestic *and* international student communities.

This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy; isolate Chinese (PRC) students *then* stereotype them as ‘antisocial’.

This isolation is now so obvious that Chinese (PRC) students’ satisfaction with opportunities to interact with Australian domestic students is almost [10% lower](https://scanloninstitute.org.au/sites/default/files/2020-01/2020-01-06_Scanlon_Scanlon-Institute_Narrative-4_FA_DIGITAL.pdf) than for other international students. If we continue to be unaware of the negative effects of our dissociation habits, this is likely to increase.

If existing negative stereotypes in our society are continuously exaggerated and perpetuated through dissociation, why are we surprised that there is a disconnect between students?

By calling Chinese (PRC) students ‘antisocial’, we are fundamentally negating our responsibility in reinforcing a self-segregating social culture in universities.

### Both Institutions and Individuals Need to Change

Years of normalising both racial stereotyping and dissociation habits has hindered the prospect of student solidarity and optimal education. So how can we be better?

To drive lasting change, improvements are needed on two levels: institutional and personal.

**On an institutional level,** Australian universities need to be more conscious of the fact that many Chinese (PRC) students [feel like they are being treated like “Cash Cows”](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/economics/article/3048769/were-cash-cows-stranded-chinese-students-upset-after-australias).

**Commodifying Chinese (PRC) students creates a cycle of stereotyping and isolation**

While universities *do* try to make international students feel welcome on campus, it can’t be ignored that international education is one of Australia’s biggest exports.

This incentivises universities to prioritise profit over structural changes needed to fully integrate international students and improve learning experiences. An example of this is that academic staff [feel obliged](https://www.spectator.com.au/2020/03/our-selfish-shameless-universities-bugger-public-health-weve-got-cash-cows-to-milk/) to pass the “fee-paying international students” even when they don’t perform up to standard rather than addressing root causes of why many students are failing in the first place.

This creates a vicious cycle:  Chinese (PRC) students feel they are treated as commodities by universities, causing tutors and other students to stereotype them as such. This encourages non-Chinese (non-PRC) students to dissociate from Chinese (PRC) students to avoid these stereotypes. In turn, Chinese (PRC) students are isolated, less motivated in university, and discouraged to engage with those not in their ‘in-group’. This increases isolation, stereotypes and dissatisfaction. Repeat cycle.

Improvements that could enhance international student life could be as simple as integrating international and local orientation weeks; efficiently communicating English language support to international students; educating tutors to be more socially inclusive without being overly fearful or dismissive; fostering an environment that enables tutors to comfortably grade every student fairly, independent of their background.

**On an individual level, our job as international students** is not to pretend stereotypes do not exist, don’t have a [real basis](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/stereotypes_june_6.pdf) or simply deflect them onto others. Instead, we need to normalise having open conversations about why stereotypes exist and how to navigate them appropriately.

If we don’t, stereotypes will continue to oversimplify the complexity and nuance behind the lives of our fellow international students that we should be willing to educate ourselves about. [VICE](https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/43d7dw/being-an-international-student-is-a-minefield-of-stereotypes-and-misconceptions) demonstrated this through interviews with international students who explained how their individual complex circumstances are often ignored and stereotyped; ‘You pay your way through university’. However, the article is still guilty of falling into the “We’re Not All Like That” mentality which perpetuates the stereotypes it attempts to eliminate.

While it’s easier in the short-run to simply go with stereotypes or dissociate from them, in the long-run this not only harms those targeted by stereotypes but fosters disconnection amongst all students.

If we are to foster connection over disconnection between all university students, it is fundamental that we start having more honest conversations with each other, especially ones that may be difficult to have.

Open conversations around grandiosity, privilege, in-groups and out-groups, even the awkwardness of the classroom divide - this is what can foster connection by enabling more nuanced understanding of our differing backgrounds.

### Creating inclusivity through open conversations

Studying in Melbourne has been an extremely positive experience for me. I came here with high expectations of ‘the most livable city in Australia’, and have found truth in that statement.

The student lifestyle is relaxed and laid-back; here I have had the independence that has enabled me to learn so much about myself and others.

That being said, I have been placed in both social and educational instances which have enabled me to observe the distinct dynamics between local and international students.

In the process, I’ve seen firsthand how ‘easy’ it is to deal with stereotypes by distancing ourselves from them. I have fallen into this pattern myself due to the situational contexts I’ve been exposed to.

I hope that I have shone a light on the prejudice that occurs within our community, how dissociation reinforces negative racial stereotypes surrounding international students - namely Chinese (PRC) students - and hopefully how we can overcome these tendencies.

I acknowledge that many international students enjoy their studies in Australia, forge genuine social connections and do not fall into stereotyping and dissociation. However, to ignore that racial stereotyping and dissociating exists only serves to perpetuate the stereotyping and exclusion of international students. It is essential that we continue pushing for a more inclusive community where we can have these nuanced conversations around stereotyping if we are to lessen its harmful effects.
