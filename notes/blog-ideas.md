## Wait calculation - https://hn.premii.com/#/comments/21446747
I am always baffled by the conundrum of the futility of launching a spacecraft to go far away by our own ability to invent faster engines.
Say it takes 300 years to get to Alpha Centauri. If you launch it you have 150 years to invent a spacecraft that goes twice the speed of the first one. Very likely. If you launch that one it will overtake the other one. Now you have 75 years to find an even faster engine. Launch it and you got 37 years. etc.
Quite likely you can keep doing this until you can reach it in e.g. a year. So why not hold all launches until then....
