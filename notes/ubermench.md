# Slow thinking

What are the qualities of slow thinking? 

- without distraction
- clear thought



## The last man

"The last man is the antithesis of the ubermensch. He seeks only comfort, consumption, security and risk minimization. The last man is deeply dissatisfied with life and is intensely jealous of the freedom, bravery and moral purpose of the ubermensch. He seeks to defeat the ubermensch in the name of equality by breaking down any distinction between the strong and weak or superior over the mediocre. A society of last men seek harmony, earn a living, keep warm and punish risk taking as an affront to equalness and safety."


## The bare-mensch

There might be an Uber state to be gained, not through constant striving, but through constant reduction. We must seek to reduce everything to it's barest simplicity - no more, but also no less. We must avoid filling our minds, always looking for something to latch on to.

As I type this now my brain is in turmoil. It has the quality of slippery-ness. What I thought about 1 minute ago seems fuzzy. This is the result of a bad brain-diet. Not only have I mistreated my brain with alcohol 2 days ago, but also with weeks of scattered information. I no longer read long articles - I like to say because they aren't information dense enough, but really because my brain no longer has the patience for them. 

## The observer

Still however, I am able to analyze my thoughts. There is a separateness between the fuzziness and the observer. The quality of my experience is not tranquilty, like it is during a long retreat, but I have not lost my capacity to observe.

This seems important. I will get older. I may lose my ability to gain tranquility, through alzheimer's, or some other disease. Will I be able to observe my suffering, my inability to reach clarity? I hope so - that would be a reprieve. To accept that I am not dependent on clarity. THere may be some state of acceptance and tranquility which is not dependent on clarity of thought.

## Dzogschen

In Dzogschen, a different question is posed. Yes I am experiencing suffering, my mind is dominated by mental afflictions like craving, hostility, greed, selfishness, but the question is different. And that is, what am I doing that is perpetuating the mess, and how can I stop?

Dzogschen, looks through the sentient mind into the one who is already awakened, and removes the layers obfuscating this fact. Dzogchen "tricks us" into tranquility, giving us a glimpse of what it "feels like" to be that person so that we may be able to find our way back to the quality of mind.


## Subtle detractors

In particular, we must pay attention to the things that affect our attention. The food we consume. The information we let into our brain. What we allow ourselves to think and daydream about. Our posture, and the way our body affects our thoughts. Poor sleep. Irregular schedules. Our environment. Reduce sensory input - screens and activities.
